Need to fix source code in the way to get it compiles, links and have following output as execution result:

started
action `one' is in process...
stopped
started
action `two' is in process...
stopped
the `Chicken and Egg' dilemma is solved!
myCat says `miaow', gnows everything and has 9 lifes
myDog says `bow-wow', gnows nothing and has 1 lifes


It is not allowed to remove whole entities (functions, classes).
